To setup an instance:

manage.py syncdb (*** Do not create superuser yet ***)
manage.py migrate
manage.py createsuperuser

Migrating to v1.0:
-install python-ipaddr lib
-update settings.py and urls.py with latest changes from dist files
Run:
manage.py migrate

If your web server is nginx, consider placing:

proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host <hostname>;
in your nginx site location part
and
USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST = True
in your settings.py. 
The above ensure that i18n operates properly when switching between languages. 

Migrating to v1.2
- Make sure to:
	- Set the RAPI_TIMEOUT in settings.py (see .dist)
	- Set the NODATA_IMAGE path in settings.py.dist
	- Update urls.py to urls.py.dist
